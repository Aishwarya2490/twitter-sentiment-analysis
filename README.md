# twitter-sentiment-analysis
Using supervised learning approach I developed a functional classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of unknown social media messages(Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc).
The project describes the study of sentiment analysis with the help of natural language processing and linear regression to classiy whether a message is positive, negative or neutral. It also gives overview of tools and application area of sentiment analysis.

# Outline of the project:
# 1.Collecting data : 
The dataset is uploaded from Kaggle website and it contains the US Airline Sentiment tweet's text and one variable with three possible sentiment values.
# 2.Analysing Data : 
Visualizing the distribution and skewness of the target variable,which shows that negative sentiments are above 8000, positive nearly 3000 and neutral about 2000-2500.
# 3.Cleaning data :
The majority of available text data is highly unstructured and noisy in nature - to achieve better insights or to build better algorithms, it is necessary to play with clean data.
# 4.Building the required model and Predicting the messgaes:
A sentiment analysis model was to be made and improved so that model can predict sentiments more accurately and it can be used at various platforms.

# Libraries used for analysis are:
1.numpy : for linear algebra
2.pandas : to organise, explore,represent and manipulate data.
3.matplotlib/seaborn : for 2D graphs and plots to visualize the data. 
4.emoji : to add emoji's and decode an emoji into its text expression. As emoji's are big part of sentiments now-a-days.
5.scikit-learn : it features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms. It is designed to interpolate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries like numpy and scipy.
6.NLTK : nltk(natural language toolkit) used for natural language processing. It is an open source and contains over fifty corporate and lexical resources.
